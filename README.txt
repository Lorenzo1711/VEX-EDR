When downloading these programs please make sure you changed the file extension to .vex otherwise Vex Coding Studio will not read the file at all. If you do not know how to change the file extension, please enable 'File name extensions' otherwise windows wont let you change the extension. You can achieve showing the file extensions by going into the file explorer on windows and going over to the 'View' tab, from there check 'File name extensions' is ticked, if it is you are good to go. After doing that rename the file, but this time it should read 'Your program.c', change this to 'Your program.vex'. After that make sure Vex Coding Studio is downloaded and open the .vex program into it, click 'Open with' and then choose 'njws or Vex Coding Studio'. If Vex Coding Studio does not show up please do not panic, this is normal if you have installed it for the first time. At the bottom of the open with dialogue (you may have to scroll down and click 'other apps') there should be an option that says 'look for another app on this PC', click that, then navigate to 'C:\Program Files (x86)\VEX Robotics\VEX Coding Studio'. Once there click 'VEX Coding Studio.exe'. It should now open for you to download your program. Please DO NOT edit otherwise VCS will be crappy as always and have save issues.
